# Purpose:
To familiarize myself with setting up a Jenkins server on an EC2 and manually deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. In past deployments, we connected to a pre-configured Jenkins server.

## Steps to Production
### 1. Provision a Jenkins Server
a. Goal
Create Jenkins server, which will allow me to automate the CI pipeline, specifically         the build, test, and zipping file stages, so we wouldnâ€™t have to waste resources and         time manually building, testing, and zipping the files separately and across                 different environments
